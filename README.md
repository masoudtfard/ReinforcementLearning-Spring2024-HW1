# Reinforcement Learning - HW1 - Spring 2024
## Sharif University of Technology
### Preliminaries

This file contains my solutions for the first assignment of the Reinforcement Learning course (CE957) at Sharif University of Technology. The assignment covers various topics including Information Theory, Optimization, Markov Chains, Bayesian Statistics, Estimation Theory, and Variational Inference. Key sections include:

- **Information Theory**: Discusses concepts such as Mutual Information, KL Divergence, and Markov Inequality.
- **Optimization**: Includes problems related to critical points, maximization and minimization, and entropy.
- **Markov Chain**: Analyzes properties of Markov chains and stationary distributions.
- **Bayesian Statistics**: Covers topics like maximum likelihood estimation.
- **Estimation Theory**: Focuses on maximum likelihood estimation for Gaussian distributions and importance-weighted sampling.
- **Variational Inference**: Discusses the Kullback-Leibler distance, ELBO maximization, and variational mixtures of Gaussians.
